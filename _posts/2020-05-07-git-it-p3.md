If there is a tool of software that every software developer must know, it is *GIT*. Everyone will agree that we all struggle with it initially, when we start learning it. So I'm here to ease the burden from the shoulders of the beginners, who are just starting with this amazing tool.

__Let's Git it!__

We'll be learning the following topics today:-

1. **[~~Understanding Git (How it Works?)~~]({% post_url 2020-05-05-git-it-p1 %}#understanding-git)**
2. **[~~Installation and Setup~~]({% post_url 2020-05-05-git-it-p1 %}#install-setup)**
3. **[~~How to Commit!~~]({% post_url 2020-05-06-git-it-p2 %}#how-to-commit)**
4. **[~~Git + Github~~]({% post_url 2020-05-06-git-it-p2 %}#git-github)**
5. **[Branching and Merging](#branching-merging)**
6. **[Rebasing](#rebasing)**
7. **[Squashing](#squashing)**

__Note :- This is the part 3 and contains the last three topics. Head to [part 1]({% post_url 2020-05-05-git-it-p1 %}) and [part 2]({% post_url 2020-05-06-git-it-p2 %}) for earlier topics.__

<h2 id="branching-merging"> Branching and Merging </h2>

Now we know that you understand basic git usage. It's time to use the most effective feature of git, branching. Branching is mostly used when we want to work on several parts/features of a project simultaneously and don't want the work on one feature affect others. Branches can be imagined in a following way:

![image alt ><](https://i2.wp.com/digitalvarys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GIT-Branchand-its-Operations.png?fit=1921%2C1057&ssl=1)

For this tutorial, this is currently the branch structure that we're having:

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81209605-5f2d1580-8fee-11ea-95c0-ac4a72b71dc0.png)

The default branch is called `master`. In order to create a new branch, run the following command:

```python
git checkout -b <branchName>
```

It creates a new branch and sets the HEAD to that branch (checkout). This is shorthand for:

```python
git branch <branchName>
git checkout <branchName>
```

We've create a branch named `Feature`, after running the mentioned commands this will be the state:

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81215383-e2eb0000-8ff6-11ea-892f-8c60ca6c65dc.png)

We're now at the head of the newly created `Feature` branch. Now make some changes and commit again. The state of the repo will change to:

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81216375-707b1f80-8ff8-11ea-8cba-94676f63e4b1.png)

You can switch between branches by simply using the `checkout` command:

```python
git checkout <branchName>
```

Note :- You cannot switch between branches before commiting the changes in you current branch.

After switching to the master branch, this will be the state:

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81221412-6ceb9680-9000-11ea-8c2b-8c26d9608a95.png)

Now let's say we make 2 more commits in the master branch.

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81222362-cd2f0800-9001-11ea-9ba4-3c318866bb07.png)

Now, what we'll do is update the `Feature` branch with the commits done in the `master branch`. This way we'll have all the updates of master branch in the `Feature` branch. First, checkout the `Feature` branch:

```python
git checkout Feature
```
![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81222833-94dbf980-9002-11ea-9dd5-fc43198803b6.png)

Now in order to have the commits of master branch you need to __merge__ master branch into feature branch, in order to merge the branches, we've already checked out the feature branch, now just run the following command:

```python
git merge master
```

Now feature branch will also have the commits and the changes done in `C4` and `C5` from master branch.

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81224929-13866600-9006-11ea-95a4-e579e4179c50.png)

Note:- The commits `C4` and `C5` in the `feature` branch are the same ones as the `master` branch i.e the commit hashes do not change and if you delete any of the commit, it'll be deleted from both the branches.

Bamm! Now you know the basics of branching and merging. Now it's time to learn one more important technique, squashing.

<h2 id="squashing"> Squashing </h2>

It may happen sometimes that you're working on a project and you're committing a lot, even for a small change you are having a commit, now you have a finished project with more than 100 commits, which is not a good thing as it'll be difficult for others and you as well to go through your commits and find the changes that you're looking for. So git provides you a very good feature of merging commits together known as squashing, it is similar to merging, the difference is that it's used to merge commits together not branches. So without wasting any more time, let's squash!

For this tutorial we'll be working entirely in `feature` branch, let's say we're in the following state:

![image alt ><](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21988675/81224929-13866600-9006-11ea-95a4-e579e4179c50.png)

And we want to squash `C4` and `C5` into one commit, say `C6`. We can do that simply by the following steps:

1. Open `git log` and copy the hash of the commit `C3`.

2. Run the `rebase` command:

    ```python
    git rebase -i <hash of C3>
    ```

    This will open in a text editor:

    ```python
    pick <hash of C4> C4
    pick <hash of C5> C5

    # Rebase f181e0e..f9c96cf onto f181e0e (2 command(s))
    #
    # Commands:
    # p, pick = use commit
    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
    # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
    # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
    # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
    # d, drop = remove commit
    #
    # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
    #
    # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
    #
    # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
    #
    # Note that empty commits are commented out

    ```

3. Now keep the first commit and change the rest from `pick` to `squash`:

    ```python
    pick <hash of C4> C4
    squash <hash of C5> C5

    # Rebase f181e0e..f9c96cf onto f181e0e (2 command(s))
    # ......

    ```

4. Save and exit the text editor. The rebase will run till the end and all the commits after C4 will get squashed into one.

5. After the rebase is done, text editor will pop-up again, now you can write the commit message for the new commit `C6`. The commits are now squashed.

6. Now if you want to push this to your remote repo, run the following command:

```python
git push -f
```

where `-f` flag means force push.

Booyah! You now know how to use git, remember, this is just the beginning and only practice can help you learn git well. With this ends our git tutorial series __Git it__. We hope that you understood the concepts well.
